# Insecurity

## What is this all about?

This project is a web application that consists of a plethora of security
vulnerabilities held together by some functionality.

This project has been created as an educational resource for workshops on
PHP web security. You could use in several ways:

* show the attendees the vulnerabilities and how to fix them
* have the attendees search for vulnerabilities
* have the attendees fix the vulnerabilities

## Warning

Never, ever put this project on any web server that is accessible from the
internet. Your server will get hacked.
